# DevFolio ðŸš€

**DevFolio** is my personal developer portfolio website built using **React.js**, showcasing my professional experience, technical skills, projects, research papers, and achievements.

This portfolio is designed not just as a static resume, but as an interactive space to explore my work and tech stack including **.NET Core**, **Javascript**, **Python**, **MongoDB**, and more.
